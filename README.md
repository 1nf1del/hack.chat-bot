# hack.chat bot

This is a bot running on [hack.chat](https://hack.chat/) for general usage. It is meant to perform tasks quicker than they would have
without it.

You can check it out by going to [?programming](https://hack.chat/?programming) and entering `.help` to get a list of commands.
It may or may not be there under the name `neelkamath_bot` as I do not have the resources to run it on a server and hence it only runs
when my computer is on.
